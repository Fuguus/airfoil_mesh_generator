# Airfoil Mesh Generator

A modular Python tool to generate and smooth computational grids around airfoils using source-controlled elliptic mesh generation and Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) techniques.

## ✈️ Overview

This project takes a specified NACA airfoil profile and:

1. **Generates boundary points** for the airfoil.
2. **Initializes a mesh grid** in a user-defined flow domain.
3. **Applies source control** and smoothing via Poisson’s equation using the SOR method.
4. **Visualizes** the airfoil, mesh (before and after smoothing), and the residual convergence.
